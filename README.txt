This project uses sessions.

Everything works well.

Steps to run server:
    (opional) Run "npm run db-init" to initialize database.
    1. Run "npm run start" to run the server.

Note:
    1. Used localhost:3000.
    2. I added an orders array to every users in database-initializer.js
    3. I added a collection 'orders' for maintaining order info.
